# Task Title: Email Sender NodeJs

### Task Objective: To send automated emails from your NodeJs app. Also to be able to implement solutions majorly by going through the documentation.
<br>

### Task Description: Create a new NodeJs app or use one you already have to send an automated email to a Gmail account.

<br>

#### You are to use "Nodemailer" (the email sender package in NodeJs). So you will install it within your project and then send a mail to your Google mail account.

<br>

#### You can try bulk messaging (optional)

<br>

#### Push codes to GitHub and briefly describe this feature in your readme file.

<br>

<br>

### This project makes use of a third party library [Nodemailer](https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer) it is a module for Node.js applications to allow easy as cake email sending. The project got started back in 2010 when there was no sane option to send email messages, today it is the solution most Node.js users turn to by default ([Nodemailer official page](https://nodemailer.com/about/)).

### Here is a screenshot of a mail i sent using nodemailer, it supports bulk messaging as seen in the last two messages sent
